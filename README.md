# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect innerHTML usage with special characters in element IDs

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to using `innerHTML` to modify the content of an HTML element that has special characters in its ID.  The bug occurs when the incorrect method of accessing the element through its ID is used, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Bug Description

2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
3. Observe the unexpected behavior or error in the browser's console.

## Solution
The solution demonstrates the correct way to access and modify the HTML content of an element with special characters in its ID, preventing the errors or unexpected behavior.  This is achieved by properly escaping or encoding the special characters within the ID string.
